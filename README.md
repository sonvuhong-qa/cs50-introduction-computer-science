# CS50 — Intro to Computer Science (My Study Notes)

This repository is where I track my learning journey through [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) — Harvard’s Introduction to Computer Science course.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo isn’t meant to replace the official course or share full solutions.
> It’s just a personal record of what I’ve learned, how I understood it, and how I struggled through it.

## 🎯 Purpose

* Keep my study progress visible and organized
* Write code as practice (not perfect)
* Document what I find interesting or confusing
* Mark milestones while I’m actually studying AI chaos elsewhere 😅

## 📚 Contents

Each folder roughly follows the CS50x weekly structure:

```
Week 0  - Scratch  
Week 1  - C  
Week 2  - Arrays  
Week 3  - Algorithms  
Week 4  - Memory  
Week 5  - Data Structures  
Week 6  - Python  
Week 7  - SQL  
Week 8  - HTML, CSS, JS  
Week 9  - Flask  
Final Project - TBD
```

Some folders might have:

* Code samples or practice solutions
* My own notes or summaries
* Random experiments related to AI or automation

## 🚀 Disclaimer

I’m doing CS50 to fill some gaps and refresh my fundamentals,
but my main focus is **AI-related chaos** — experiments, models, and automation.

If you found this repo, take it as a study log, not a guide.
You’ll probably see messy commits and weird test files — that’s on purpose. :)
